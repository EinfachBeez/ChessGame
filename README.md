# Simple-Chess-Game

A Simple Console Chess Game in C working with 2D Arrays.

Inspired by the university homework "Assignment 4: A Simplified Single-player Chess Game" from 10/10/2013

## Attention

The compiled version in /out/compile can be run on Windows, but there is no ANSI color support like on Linux. 
So the console will look a bit funny.

## ToDo

- No Jump Over (except night)
- Pawn Rules (Hit Rule, Check rule for multible squares at first move, Pawn transform)
- No king next to king
- Patt (when both players have only one king left)
